Install a WordPress plugin with FTP
You may need to install a WordPress plugin through FTP. This option is useful for large or custom plugins.
You'll need an FTP client to upload the files. We recommend FileZilla.

Unzip the plugin files on your local computer (Windows or MacOS).
Connect to your hosting with FTP.
In the Remote site section of FileZilla, find the folder with your WordPress site.
Navigate to the /wp-content/plugins folder.
In the Local site section of FileZilla, find the plugin folder on your local computer.
Drag and drop the plugin folder from the Local site section to the Remote site section.

After you install a plugin, you need to activate it from within WordPress.

Install a Plugin using the WordPress Admin Plugin Upload
Paid WordPress plugins are not listed in the WordPress plugin directory. These plugins cannot be installed using the first method.

That’s why WordPress comes with the upload method to install such plugins. We will show you how to install WordPress plugins using the upload option in the admin area.

First, you need to download the plugin from the source (which will be a zip file). Next, you need to go to WordPress admin area and visit Plugins » Add New page.

After that, click on the ‘Upload Plugin’ button on top of the page.

After you have selected the file, you need to click on the ‘Install Now’ button.

WordPress will now upload the plugin file from your computer and install it for you. You will see a success message like this after the installation is finished.

Once installed, you need to click on the Activate Plugin link to start using the plugin.

You would have to configure the settings to fit your needs. These settings will vary for each plugin therefore we will not be covering that in this post.
